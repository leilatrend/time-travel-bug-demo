# 🧠 Time Travel Bug Demo

This repository demonstrates an AI-powered workflow for investigating which Git commit likely introduced a bug. The project simulates a real-world Node.js application with intentionally placed bugs across different commits to test debugging capabilities.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This demo contains a full-featured Node.js application with:

- **Form handling system** with validation and CRUD operations
- **User management** with authentication and sessions
- **File upload system** with validation and storage
- **API documentation generator** with interactive HTML output
- **Performance monitoring** with metrics and alerts
- **Advanced caching system** with LRU eviction and TTL
- **Security utilities** with input sanitization and rate limiting

**The catch**: Four subtle bugs are intentionally hidden in different commits to test AI-powered debugging workflows.

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Form Management

- `POST /api/forms` - Create form
- `GET /api/forms/:id` - Get form by ID
- `PUT /api/forms/:id` - Update form
- `DELETE /api/forms/:id` - Delete form

### User Management

- `POST /api/users/register` - Register user (🐛 **Bug 1 here**)
- `POST /api/users/login` - User login
- `GET /api/users/profile` - Get user profile
- `PUT /api/users/profile` - Update profile

### File Management  

- `POST /api/files/upload` - Upload file (🐛 **Bug 2 & 3 here**)
- `GET /api/files/:id` - Get file info
- `GET /api/files/:id/download` - Download file
- `DELETE /api/files/:id` - Delete file

### System

## 🤖 AI Debugging Workflow

This repository is designed to test AI systems that can:

1. **Analyze error messages** and stack traces
2. **Correlate bugs with commit history**
3. **Identify the most likely problematic commit**
4. **Provide reasoning** for the analysis
5. **Suggest fixes** or investigation steps

---

## 🛠️ Development Notes

### Design Principles

- **Realistic complexity**: The application has real features, not just toy examples
- **Subtle bugs**: Errors that require actual investigation, not obvious typos
- **Layered architecture**: Multiple modules with proper separation of concerns
- **Production patterns**: Uses real-world patterns like middleware, validation, logging
- **Bug evolution**: Includes both active bugs and historical fixes for comprehensive analysis

### Adding New Bugs

To add more test bugs:

1. Create a new feature in a separate commit
2. Introduce a subtle bug with a `🐛` comment
3. Add several more commits after it
4. Document the bug in this README
