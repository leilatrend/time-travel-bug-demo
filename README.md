# üß† Time Travel Bug Demo

This repository demonstrates an AI-powered workflow for investigating which Git commit likely introduced a bug. The project simulates a real-world Node.js application with intentionally placed bugs across different commits to test debugging capabilities.

---

## üîç Project Overview

This demo contains a full-featured Node.js application with:

- **Form handling system** with validation and CRUD operations
- **User management** with authentication and sessions
- **File upload system** with validation and storage
- **API documentation generator** with interactive HTML output
- **Performance monitoring** with metrics and alerts
- **Advanced caching system** with LRU eviction and TTL
- **Security utilities** with input sanitization and rate limiting

**The catch**: Four subtle bugs are intentionally hidden in different commits to test AI-powered debugging workflows.

## ÔøΩ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/leilatrend/time-travel-bug-demo.git
cd time-travel-bug-demo

# Install dependencies

## ü§ñ AI Debugging Workflow

This repository is designed to test AI systems that can:

1. **Analyze error messages** and stack traces
2. **Correlate bugs with commit history**
3. **Identify the most likely problematic commit**
4. **Provide reasoning** for the analysis
5. **Suggest fixes** or investigation steps

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes

### Design Principles

- **Realistic complexity**: The application has real features, not just toy examples
- **Subtle bugs**: Errors that require actual investigation, not obvious typos
- **Layered architecture**: Multiple modules with proper separation of concerns
- **Production patterns**: Uses real-world patterns like middleware, validation, logging
- **Bug evolution**: Includes both active bugs and historical fixes for comprehensive analysis
